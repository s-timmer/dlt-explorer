# Spacing & Radius

Layout spacing uses semantic tokens derived from CSS custom properties. Border radius uses a custom scale derived from a single `--radius` base token.

## Border Radius

Base token: `--radius: 0.625rem` (10px). All other sizes are computed relative to this.

## Semantic Spacing Tokens

Spacing in explore components uses semantic tokens defined as CSS custom properties in `globals.css` and mapped to Tailwind via `@theme inline`. Changing a single `--explore-*` variable in `:root` updates all components that use that token.

## Design Decisions

- **Semantic tokens over raw values** — `gap-section` is more readable than `gap-6` and ensures consistency. When tweaking spacing during design review, change the token once and every instance updates.
- **Single radius base token** — changing `--radius` from 0.625rem to any other value rescales the entire system. This makes it trivial to go from rounded to sharp (set to 0) or pill-shaped (set to 1.5rem).
- **Increasing radius for larger surfaces** — small elements (bars) get radius-sm, cards get radius-xl. This follows the optical principle that larger shapes need more rounding to appear equally rounded to the eye.
- **Consistent card padding** — `p-card` (16px) for card internals. Token-driven, so it can be adjusted globally without hunting through individual components.
- **5-tier spacing scale** — chip (6px) → tight (10px) → element (12px) → card (16px) → section (24px). Each level serves a distinct relationship type, from inline items to major sections.
