# Color Palette

All colors use the **oklch** color space for perceptual uniformity. Tokens are defined as CSS custom properties in `globals.css` and mapped to Tailwind utilities via `@theme inline`.

## Semantic Colors

These are the core UI colors. Each has a foreground counterpart for text on that surface.

## Chart Colors

Five purpose-built data visualization colors, optimized for distinguishability in bar charts and stat cards.

## Design Decisions

- **oklch color space** — perceptually uniform, so a lightness of 0.5 *looks* like mid-gray regardless of hue. Makes it easy to reason about contrast ratios.
- **Near-white background** with warm hue angle (80) — subtle warmth that avoids the clinical feel of pure white, without looking "creamy". The card surface is slightly lighter for layering.
- **Neutral grays** for UI chrome (secondary, muted, border, input) — keeps the interface quiet so data stands out.
- **Five chart colors** span warm to cool to warm on the hue wheel, maximizing visual separation for adjacent bars.
- **Light mode only** — dark mode tokens are defined but unused. One polished mode is better than two half-finished ones.
