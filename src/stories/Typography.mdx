# Typography

Two typefaces, loaded via `next/font/google` as CSS custom property font stacks.

## Type Scale

Tailwind's default type scale, applied through utility classes. We use a constrained subset to maintain visual hierarchy.

## Design Decisions

- **Inter** — chosen for its large x-height and open apertures, which keep small text (text-xs, text-sm) readable in dense data tables. The variable font keeps bundle size low.
- **JetBrains Mono** — the best monospace font for code readability. Distinguished characters are critical when SQL snippets are displayed alongside data.
- **Constrained scale** — most UI uses just `text-sm` and `text-xs`. This keeps the interface dense without feeling cluttered, matching the data-heavy context where screen real estate matters.
- **Weight restraint** — three weights maximum (400, 500, 600). Bold (700) is intentionally avoided to keep the interface calm and let data stand out instead of chrome.
