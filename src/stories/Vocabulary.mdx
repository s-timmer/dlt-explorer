# Vocabulary

The interface speaks the user's language, not the database's. Every label, count, and heading uses terms that a data scientist already knows from pandas and notebooks.

## The mapping

<VocabularyTable />

## Why this matters

This isn't cosmetic. A data scientist seeing "varchar" and "bigint" feels like they've opened the wrong tool. They think in DataFrames and records, not tables and rows. The vocabulary shift signals: *this tool was built for you.*

The rule is simple: if pandas uses a different word than PostgreSQL, we use the pandas word.

## Design Decisions

- **"datasets" not "tables"** — dlt creates flat tables with `__` separators for nested data (e.g. `issues__labels`). We group these under entities and call them datasets, which matches how data scientists think about data: as collections, not database objects.
- **"records" not "rows"** — A record is something with meaning. A row is a position in a grid. Data scientists work with records.
- **"fields" not "columns"** — Consistent with JSON, pandas `.columns`, and general data science terminology. Also shorter, which helps in dense schema views.
- **Friendly type labels** — `text`, `number`, `date` instead of `varchar`, `bigint`, `timestamp`. The underlying types are still available in the schema detail, but the first impression uses plain language.
