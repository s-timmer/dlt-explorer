# dlt Data Explorer

A data scientist native catalog viewer for [dlt](https://dlthub.com) datasets. Built with real GitHub data loaded through a dlt pipeline.

## What it does

Renders dlt pipeline output as a browsable catalog. Four entity cards instead of 16 flat datasets, AI-generated descriptions from the schema, smart field ordering that surfaces identity fields before infrastructure, and vocabulary that speaks the data scientist's language (datasets, records, fields) instead of the database's (tables, rows, columns).

## Design decisions

The explorer is designed for data scientists, not data engineers. Light mode, proportional fonts, notebook-native aesthetic. The thinking behind each decision is documented on the [design rationale](/rationale) page within the explorer itself.

## How it works

1. A dlt pipeline loads GitHub data into DuckDB
2. Data is exported as static JSON files
3. Next.js renders the catalog from those files
4. Descriptions are pre-generated by an LLM from the schema

No runtime API calls, no database connection. The catalog is rendered output, like `df.head()` in a notebook.
